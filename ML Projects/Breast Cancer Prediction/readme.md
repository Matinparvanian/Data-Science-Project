# Breast Cancer Prediction: An Analysis of Classification Models

## Introduction
Breast cancer is a significant health concern worldwide, affecting millions of individuals. Early detection and accurate prediction of breast cancer can greatly improve patient outcomes and survival rates. This project systematically analyzes various classification models to predict breast cancer, leveraging statistical learning techniques.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Model Building**
   - Evaluate multiple classification models:
     1. **Logistic Regression**
     2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
     3. **Naive Bayes**
     4. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
     5. **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compare the performance of different models.
   - Focus on minimizing false negatives to ensure most cancer cases are detected.

7. **Conclusion**
 At the end, the best model is chosen based on the comparison of different metrics for various models.
   
9. **Tools and Technologies**
- Python
- Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter Notebook
